## The assignment clearly states to only extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
## I have interpreted this as only the measurements/features ending in mean()-XYZ or std()-XYZ.
## Other features were weighted averages (e.g. features ending in meanFreq() ), or additional vectors which were not obtained through measuring the signals from the gyroscope and accelerometer

needed_columns <- grep("(label|mean\\(\\)-[XYZ]|std\\(\\)-[XYZ])$", colnames(data)) # select the columns we need (as described above)
needed_columns # shows a list of the features we kept

# Finalize the data as described so that we are up to the 4th step of the assignment
final_data <- data[, needed_columns]
sum(is.na(final_data)) # There are no NAs

final_data <- arrange(final_data, activity_label, subject_label)

## Step 5: create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
## My interpretation is that for each (measurement) variable I have to show the average of each activity (WALKING, LAYING, etc...) and each subject (1, 2, 3, ... , 30)
## Therefore each observations will contain one measurement variable, which gives a total of 48 rows
## The number of columns will add up to 37: 1 column "measurement_variables", 6 columns with means of the activities, and 30 with means of each of the thirty subject.
## So my second, independent tidy data set with be a [48,37] matrix
